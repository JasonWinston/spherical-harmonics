# Sphereical Harmonics


The irradiance is an integral over the upper hemisphere in the direction of the normal.

Spherical harmonics are a set of orthogonal functions on the sphere. Also orthonormal.

They form a set of basis functions (like fourier series) which can be summed to approximate a function.

Spherical harmonics are analogous to Fourier transforms. But, they are defined on a sphere rather than a circle. Real and complex, but we only care about real.

Prove its rotationally invariant?


The spherical harmonics are defined in terms of legendre polynomials.


### Encoding

(Ramaoorthi)
To find the 9 lighting coeffecients you integrate the irradiance with the basis functions.

The integration is sort of like a continuous rather than discrete dot product.

### Decoding

Scale the basis functions by the coeffecients and add them together.
